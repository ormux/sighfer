### Ciphers Available (Rainbow People Update)
| Cipher    | Description |
------------|-------------|
| Atbash    | monoalphabetic substitution cipher originally used by Hebrews to encrypt the Torah and essentially uses a reversed alphabet |
| Base64    | an encoding scheme which translates ASCII into radix-64 representation, used to transfer binary data through text only channels e.g. HTTP |
| Caesar    | a shift cipher named after Julius Caesar, which utilises numeric shifts to displace each letter of a text by the same integer value |
| Reversal  | this is a modified version of the Reversal Cipher which only reverses each word and does not reverse the sentence itself |
| Rot13     | a special case of the Caesar Cipher which has an integer key of 13, encryption and decryption are the inverse of each other |
| Vigenere  | a shift cipher that uses a series of interwoven Caesar Ciphers together shifting each character by a different value depending on the cipher key |
